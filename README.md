  <i>~ The Ambient Gateway Idle Game ~</i><br>
  <b>Your Hermes gateway boosts your progression as an upgradeable multiplier.</b>
</p>

## ✦ What Is This?

Hermes IdleViber is an **ambient idle/incremental game** that lives in your browser — a cozy pixel-art universe where you click, earn, upgrade, and unlock themed rooms while chiptune music plays and particle effects drift across the screen.

**The twist?** The game pings your local Hermes Agent gateway and turns its latency into a VPS multiplier. The faster your gateway responds, the bigger the bonus. It turns your dev tools into a game mechanic — an upgradeable boost you can invest prestige chips into.

**Sign in** with Google, GitHub, or email/password — your progress follows you across devices via Firestore cloud saves with smart merge (keeps your highest stats).

---

## ✦ How It Works

### 1. Click ✦ VIBE ✦
Hit the big glowing button. Each click earns vibes (the game's currency). Click power scales with upgrades.

### 2. Buy Autoclickers
Each room has **15 unique upgrade tiers**, themed to that room. Every upgrade adds passive VPS (Vibes Per Second). Costs scale exponentially (1.15× per purchase).

**⚡ Buy All** button on every upgrade tab — sorts by most expensive first and spends every last vibe.

**🖱 Hold-to-spam** — hold down on any upgrade to rapid-buy (works on autoclickers AND prestige upgrades).

### 3. Unlock Rooms
6 themed rooms, each with its own music, background, particle effects, and **completely independent upgrade progression**:

| Room | Cost | Vibe |
|------|------|------|
| 🏕 **Campfire Grove** | Free | Warm fire under starry skies |
| 💻 **Cyber Den** | 100M ✦ | Neon-lit digital hideout |
| 🧘 **Zen Garden** | 1B ✦ | Bamboo, koi, and flowing water |
| 🔭 **Star Deck** | 25B ✦ | Floating among galaxies |
| 📚 **Study Lounge** | 1T ✦ | Cozy bookshelves & lamplight |
| 🏖 **Beach Cove** | 10T ✦ | Sunset waves on pixel sand |

Each room's autoclickers track their own purchase count — buying cheap upgrades in a new room doesn't reset your expensive ones from other rooms. All room VPS stacks together globally.

### 4. Decor Every Room
15 decor items per room (90 total across all rooms, matching upgrade icons). Each adds a permanent VPS multiplier to that room.

### 5. Prestige & Tiers
Reset your run for **Prestige Chips (PP)** — permanent currency that buys escalating upgrades:
- Gateway buffs (+× to gateway multiplier)
- Click multipliers (×2 → ×4 → ×10)
- Base VPS bonuses (+100 → +1K → +10K)
- Permanent ×2 VPS (stacks multiplicatively)
- Offline earnings rate boosts

All prestige upgrades are **re-buyable** with progressive cost scaling. Use the **Buy All** button or hold-to-spam to burn through chips fast.

**⚡ Max Prestige** button runs non-blocking batches (500 prestige cycles via requestAnimationFrame) — no UI freeze. Uses BigNumber math throughout for overflow safety.

Every prestige grants a **Tier** (Bronze I → Silver I → ... → Formless Expanse), unlocking a corresponding achievement. **500 uniquely-scaling tiers** with requirements going from 1 prestige up to `InfZ^∞`. Tier progression accelerates through normal suffixes into InfZ ×N notation, with the final tiers reaching InfZ^∞ territory. Tiers grant progressively stronger permanent bonuses (×click, ×VPS, ×all, +offline%, room unlock speed) at 65% more conservative scaling than before.

### 6. Gateway Bonus
The game pings your Hermes gateway every 5 seconds. Your latency determines your VPS multiplier — lower latency = higher bonus. No gateway running? You still earn at base rates. Gateway buffs can also be upgraded with prestige chips for an even bigger boost.

The Gateway tab shows a **2-line HUD**: VPS multiplier on line 1, latency + prestige breakdown on line 2. Manual port override available. Auto-scans common ports instantly, plus the web server range (1024-10000) in ~20s.

### 7. InfinityZ Number System
When your vibes exceed Z (the last suffix tier), the number system cycles through infinite layers of InfZ^n notation:

| Layer | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Normal | `{value}{suffix}` | `1.23k`, `4.56M` ... `7.89Z` |
| InfZ^1 | `InfZ ×N[suffix]` | `InfZ ×1`, `InfZ ×1k` ... `InfZ ×1Z`, `InfZ ×2` |
| InfZ² | `InfZ² (N[suffix])` | `InfZ² (1)`, `InfZ² (1k)` ... `InfZ² (1Z)`, `InfZ² (2)` |
| InfZ³ | `InfZ³ [N[suffix]]` | `InfZ³ [1]`, `InfZ³ [1k]` ... `InfZ³ [2]` |
| InfZ⁴ | `InfZ⁴ {N[suffix]}` | `InfZ⁴ {1}`, `InfZ⁴ {1k}` ... |
| ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ |
| InfZ^∞ | `InfZ^∞` | Final sentinel for numbers beyond comprehension |

Each layer cycles through base + all 47 (or 56 for plain-number) suffixes per count. When a count wraps, the next layer takes over. The game literally never runs out of notation.

Under the hood, all numbers use a **BigNumber (BN) system** — stored as `[mantissa, exponent]` arrays in scientific notation, supporting unlimited growth with automatic normalization and overflow guards.

### 🎨 Visual
- **270+ pixel art icons** — 90 room upgrade icons + 90 decor icons + tier/prestige/P2P icons + PC tiers + synergy icons, all generated via Codex CLI (16-bit retro style) chroma-key processed to 256×256 lossless WebP
- **24 room-themed pixel art button frames** — 6 materials × 4 sizes (wood grain rivets for Campfire Grove, glowing circuit traces for Cyber Den, mossy cobblestone for Zen Garden, brushed stainless steel for Star Deck, brass+gold engraved for Study Lounge, light wood+seashell for Beach Cove). Applied to all buttons via `background-image: var(--room-btn-img)` with `image-rendering: pixelated` and auto-switching per room
- **Adaptive text contrast** — all UI text uses white fill with 8-direction black text-shadow outer stroke for readability over any button image. Active sidebar tab inverts to black fill + white stroke. Buttons dim via `filter: brightness(0.85)` on hover instead of solid background overlay (button image stays visible)
- **Room-colored active tab glow** — selected sidebar tab gets `inset box-shadow` + `box-shadow` + `text-shadow` using the room's accent color
- Smoother hover/active states — no cyan borders on any buttons, only the button image
- 6 unique room backgrounds with atmospheric effects
- **Login screen video wallpaper** — looping MP4 with seamless 1.5s crossfade (dual canvas/video handoff)
- **Room backgrounds use dual-video handoff** — instead of native `<video loop>` (which has a built-in seek pause), two non-looping videos crossfade at 1.5s for perfectly seamless looping
- **Ping-pong mode** for Campfire & Study — pre-captured frames animated forward/backward
- Particle systems: fireflies, matrix rain, cherry blossoms, aurora, smoke, dust, waves
- Godrays & dynamic lighting
- **180Hz render loop** with delta-time frame interpolation — particle speed consistent at any framerate
- Pixel-perfect rendering with `image-rendering: pixelated`
- Custom chroma-key removal pipeline for transparent icon assets
- **3-line InfZ display** on prestige chip box and Total This Round stat box
- **Room-themed pixel art buttons** for all 6 rooms (cg/cd/zg/sd/sl/bc) with auto-detected text contrast

### 🏅 Leaderboard
- **P2P ECDSA Crypto Mesh** — players connect via direct peer-to-peer data channels (WebRTC) using Firestore as a signaling server. Every broadcast is signed with ECDSA P-256 and verified by the receiving peer. 100-byte binary packets carry all columns.
- **Live All-Column Sync** — VIBES, VPS, PP, PRESTIGE, and TIER columns update in real-time across the mesh.
- **P2P Failsafes** — when broadcast reaches 0 peers, automatically rescans the signaling directory, re-fetches peer keys, and initiates fresh WebRTC connections. Three-layer safety: per-tick reconnect on 0-sent (100ms), 15s repair timer, 30s full directory scan when isolated.
- **Firestore fallback** — when P2P fails (NAT restrictions, no peers), automatically switches to Firestore onSnapshot or polling (30s interval)
- **Deterministic Offerer Tiebreaker** — keyId → random nonce → username always picks one peer as the offerer, no stalemates
- **Bulletproof formatting** — every cell wrapped in try/catch with type guards and safe fallbacks
- Stores full BN arrays for accurate InfinityZ layer display
- VPS column alongside vibes, prestige, and PP columns
- Adaptive grid columns that scale with viewport
- **Sort chain**: highest tier → prestige → PP → VPS → Vibes (all descending)
- Clear polling when Firestore subscription starts — no double reads, respects quota

### ⚙️ Settings

## ✦ Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Direct (no server needed)
cd F:\aaaaaVIBECODING\Hermes-IdleViber\
start index.html

# Option 2: With HTTP server (recommended)
cd F:\aaaaaVIBECODING\Hermes-IdleViber\
node server/index.js
# Open http://localhost:4444

# Option 3: Netlify (always live)
# https://hermes-idleviber.netlify.app
```

**Bonus:** Hermes Agent running locally gives you a latency-based VPS multiplier. No gateway? The game still works fine at base rates.

## ✦ Recent Updates

- **Room-Themed Button System** — 24 pixel art button frames (6 rooms × 4 sizes) generated via Codex CLI: wood grain with rivets (Campfire Grove), glowing cyan circuit traces (Cyber Den), mossy cobblestone (Zen Garden), brushed stainless steel (Star Deck), brass+gold engraved (Study Lounge), light wood+seashell (Beach Cove). All buttons dynamically swap per room via CSS custom properties with `image-rendering: pixelated` and `background-size: 100% 100%`.
- **Unified Text Contrast System** — all UI text uses white fill with 8-direction black outer stroke via `text-shadow` for consistent readability over any background. Active sidebar tab inverts to black fill + white stroke. Colored functional text (gold prestige, cyan values) retains its fill color. Buttons dim via `filter: brightness(0.85)` on hover instead of solid background overlay (button image stays visible, text keeps color).
- **Cyan Borders Removed** — all pixel buttons, sidebar tabs, login buttons, and music controls had their 2px cyan borders removed. The button image IS the button now. Active tab gets a room-colored glow (`box-shadow` + `text-shadow`) instead of a blue border.
- **Adaptive Tab Labels** — sidebar tab text uses adaptive contrast. Tab labels cleaned up (emojis removed).
- **Icon Overhaul** — all 90 room upgrade icons + 90 room decor icons regenerated via Codex CLI with new item names (cg_log_stool→cg_fire_ring, cd_digital_clock→cd_holographic_display, etc.). Chroma-key processed with aspect-ratio preservation to 256×256 lossless WebP. Decor `.png` references in sprites.js updated to `.webp`.
- **Tooltip Icons 20% Larger** — `.tt-icon-img` increased from 128px to 154px for better visibility.

- **Decor Canvas Overhaul** — decor items now render at 40% size (102×102) on canvas, single instance per decor type enforced, equip/unequip restores to saved positions without placement mode, drag reworked for instant cursor follow (no lerp lag), positions survive prestige via `saved_decor_placements`
- **Room Divider Images** — switched from webp to user-cropped PNG banners, room prefix lookup fixed (was using `roomId.substring(0,2)` which produced wrong filenames), 5× larger with `object-position: top center` to prevent top cropping
- **Login Screen Video Wallpaper** — looping MP4 covers full screen behind login box with seamless 1.5s crossfade using single-video + first-frame canvas overlay (same technique as room backgrounds)
- **Smooth Room Backgrounds** — replaced native `<video loop>` (which has a built-in seek pause) with dual-video handoff: two non-looping videos crossfade at 1.5s margin, no native loop, no pause. CROSSFADE_SEC increased from 0.8 to 1.5.
- **P2P Connection Failsafes** — `broadcast()` now triggers `_rescanPeers()` when 0 peers are reachable. New `_rescanPeers()` method reconnects failed peers and scans the full Firestore signaling directory for undiscovered players. Three-layer: per-tick (100ms), 15s repair, 30s full scan.
- **Real-time Room Affordability** — room cards in the Rooms tab now update their `affordable` CSS class every tick without needing to switch tabs. Added `data-room-id` attribute for per-card lookup.
- **Server MIME Types** — added `.webp` (image/webp) and `.mp4` (video/mp4) to the dev server's MIME types so browsers correctly render webp images and mp4 videos.
- **P2P WebRTC Mesh Leaderboard** — players connect via direct peer-to-peer data channels (WebRTC) using Firestore as a signaling server. Scores broadcast in real-time across the mesh. Automatically falls back to Firestore onSnapshot/polling when P2P is unavailable. Hourly Firestore sync for long-term persistence.
- **ECDSA P-256 Crypto Layer (JSON Messaging)** — every broadcast is signed with ECDSA P-256 and verified by the receiving peer. Messages are JSON text carrying full BN arrays `[mantissa, exponent]` — no float64 precision loss, no Infinity overflow. `formatBN` renders the exact InfZ notation on the receiving end.
- **Deterministic Offerer Tiebreaker** — when two peers discover each other, a guaranteed-decidable tournament (keyId → random nonce → username) picks one side to create the WebRTC offer. No more "both wait for the other" stalemates.
- **5-Second Ping Discovery** — every peer refreshes its Firestore signaling doc every 5 seconds. Peers appear and disappear in real-time, with automatic reconnection on failure.
- **15-Second Reconnection Timer** — scans peers every 15s; if a peer's channel is closed or failed, it re-fetches the sig doc and reconnects automatically.
- **Stale Signaling Cleanup** — old offer/answer docs from failed connection attempts are auto-deleted instead of looping on retry forever.
- **Double-Init Race Guard** — `p2pStarting` mutex prevents two concurrent P2P initialization attempts from creating conflicting managers.
- **Live All-Column Sync** — VIBES, VPS, PP, PRESTIGE, and TIER columns update in real-time across the mesh, with full BN InfZ notation for each value.
- **DEV Badge Name Matching** — the DEV badge tooltip in DrGekoz's leaderboard row embedded extra text in the `.lb-name` element. The P2P row-matching logic now strips `(DEV)` and tooltip content so the name comparison works correctly.
- **Bulletproof Leaderboard Formatting** — every cell is wrapped with try/catch, type guards, BN array handling via `formatBN`, and safe fallbacks. `formatBN` is now properly exported from state.js and imported throughout the app.
- **BigNumber System Hardening** — all game values now guarded with `_bnGuard()` for null/undefined/isFinite recovery. `BN_MAX` sentinel prevents infinite exponent overflow. Arithmetic functions return gracefully on overflow instead of crashing. Cloud migration handles malformed BN arrays.
- **Cloud Save Merge** — instead of blindly overwriting, cloud saves now merge with local saves keeping the highest prestiges, total PP, and lifetime vibes. Smart progress preservation across devices.
- **Max Prestige Batching** — runs in non-blocking 500-cycle batches via `requestAnimationFrame` — no UI freeze even at extreme VPS levels. BigNumber math throughout.
- **Prestige Overhaul** — Max Prestige uses math formula, runs instantly; prestige threshold scales dynamically with VPS (log₂ factor), stops at 1hr cap; gentler sqrt-log formula for early-game pacing; 1.06× tier scaling
- **180Hz Render Loop** — delta-time frame interpolation keeps particle effects and animations smooth and speed-consistent at any refresh rate
- **3-line InfZ Display** — prestige chip box, Total This Round stat box, and prestige chip gain text all show 3-line InfZ formatted values
- **Gateway HUD Redesign** — VPS multiplier on line 1, latency + prestige breakdown on line 2; manual port override
- **Tier Achievements** — 500 programmatic tier achievements, one per prestige tier (Bronze I → Formless Expanse), generated on the fly
- **Realtime Leaderboard** — live tier column (Bronze→Silver→Gold→...), BN-accurate InfZ values, VPS column, adaptive grid, dev badge tooltip on hover
- **Google & GitHub OAuth Login** — sign in with Google or GitHub accounts, or email/password. Settings overlay with name, audio, credits tabs, sidebar position toggle, gateway port sync, and Buy Me a Coffee support.
- **Offline Stats Enhancement** — offline rate switches to 10x format above 1000%
- **InfinityZ number system** — numbers beyond Z display as `InfZ ×N`, `InfZ ×1k`, ... `InfZ ×1Z`, `InfZ ×2` cycling through InfZ^n notation with distinct brackets per power layer
- **Buy All buttons** — ⚡ Buy All on upgrades, decor, and prestige tabs (buys most expensive first, spends everything)
- **Hold-to-spam** — works for both autoclicker upgrades AND prestige upgrades
- **Real-time tab indicators** — sidebar tabs show gold/green/cyan dots when items are affordable or ready
- **127+ pixel art icons** — 78 autoclicker, 49 prestige/decor, and 102 decor placement sprites — all Codex CLI-generated 16-bit pixel art
- **Per-room cost progression** — costs track the current room's purchase count, not global
- **Prestige cost fixes** — progressive cost scaling for all re-buyable prestige upgrades
- **Dev badge tooltip** — hover over your name on the leaderboard to see contributor status
- **Icon re-encoding** — all prestige/autoclicker icons re-encoded to smaller file sizes for faster loading
- **500 Tiers** — expanded from 250 to 500 uniquely-scaling tiers with cosmic InfZ-themed naming. Requirements use BN (BigNumber) from tier 1, accelerating from `1 → 2.1M → InfZ ×N → InfZ^∞`. 65% more conservative bonuses. `total_prestiges` is now a BN for infinite precision.
- **InfZ^n Number Display** — number system now shows proper InfZ^n notation with bracket styles: `InfZ ×N` (InfZ^1), `InfZ² (N)` (InfZ²), `InfZ³ [N]` (InfZ³), onward through `InfZ^∞` for numbers beyond all comprehension
- **Prestige Upgrade BN Pricing** — prestige upgrade costs now use BigNumber arithmetic (`bnPow` + `getPrestigeUpgradeCost`) instead of `Math.pow`, removing the Infinity cap that made high-count upgrades permanently unpurchasable
- **Max Prestige Silent Batching** — rewritten to suppress all `notifyStateChange` during the batch loop, eliminating the browser lockup that occurred with 1500+ UI rebuilds per click
- **Prestige UI BN Comparison Fixes** — all `gain > 0`, `gain <= 0`, `chips >= cost` comparisons now use proper BN comparison functions (`bnGt`, `bnLe`, `bnGe`) instead of native JS which silently failed on BN arrays

## ✦ Design Principles

- **Ambient First** — The primary experience is hanging out in a beautiful pixel space, not optimizing spreadsheets
- **Gateway as Bonus** — Your Hermes gateway isn't the core loop, it's a tasty VPS multiplier on top. Play without it just fine, but if you've got a snappy gateway you'll climb faster. Prestige chips let you crank that multiplier even higher.
- **Per-Room Identity** — Every room is a distinct gameplay silo with its own progression, music, and art
- **Zero External Assets** — Every sprite, every sound, every particle is generated at runtime (music files excluded)
- **Progressive Complexity** — Easy to start (click the button), deep to master (prestige × tiers × 6 rooms × 90 decor × InfinityZ numbers × P2P leaderboard)
